      <p>Hey!</p>
      
      <p>I&rsquo;m <a href="http://ezekielbinion.com">Zeke Binion,</a> a User Experience Generalist (<abbr title="also known as">aka</abbr> designer, researcher, and coder) hailing from Chicago. I have over a decade of experience in design and technology. Over the course of that time, I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of leading a hybrid team of UX designers and developers, working for a number of design agencies, and designing for a wide range of companies from the Fortune 100 to mom-and-pop shops.</p>
      
      <p>But enough about me, this is about you!</p>
      
      <p>Code for Designers is about helping you learn to code, in the way designers, like you and me, like to learn. No more boring demos, technical babble, or ugly examples — I&rsquo;ll help you finally learn what it takes to go from idea to execution.</p>
      
      <p>I can&rsquo;t wait to start sharing what I&rsquo;ve learned with you. Right now I&rsquo;m designing the video lessons, writing articles, and designing fun exercises to let your imagination run free.</p>
