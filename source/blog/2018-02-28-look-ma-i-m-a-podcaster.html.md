As a designer that codes, it can be hard to find podcasts that talk about technology and development through the lens of design. So [Matt Reich](https://mattreich.net/) (front-end development extraordinaire) and I started a podcast to do just that! [Productship.fm](http://www.productship.fm/) is a show dedicated to discussing the intersection of digital product design and development. We're available on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/productship-fm/id1341515784), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/I77cjhudcq5zbcntrxyqzq5ychu), and many others.

Listen to the first episode above.
