As you grow as a coder, it can seem like there aren't many places to practice your new found skill because many people in your organization are likely better at coding than you. That's ok, your value as a designer isn't diminished by not being the best coder on your team.

As a beginner, you'll need places where you can use your new found skills outside of writing code on projects. What better place to put your coding skills to use, than in your communication to your team?

In this episode, I'll show you how to use a markup language, called Markdown, to improve the way you communicate with your project teams. Along the way you'll see how I use it to insert Gifs, create checklists, and style my comments on projects to improve my communication with my project team.
